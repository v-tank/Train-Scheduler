# Train-Scheduler
A train scheduler built using JS/jQuery, Firebase, Moment.js, HTML and CSS.

### What:
This is a web app created using JS/jQuery, Bootstrap framework, and CSS to display a train schedule based on a user's entry. The user's train data is stored using Firebase. I used the Moment.js library in order to calculate the next arrival time as well as the time remaining (in minutes) until the next train. 

### Why:
Why not?! This was a great way to learn how to push and retrieve data from Firebase. I also learned about the Moment.js library, which is a convenient way to handle dates and times. 

### How to get started:
Feel free to clone the repo to access the code to get started. You will, however, have to sign up for your own Firebase account and create a new project if you're interested in seeing the database in action. Replace the database script in the app.js file with your unique app information that is generated by Firebase.

### How to look for help:
Reach out to me if you need help understanding any of the code for this app; I'd be happy to explain it to you!
